# vanity

she sits at her dresser<br/>
eyes glued to the mirror<br/>
staring as though wanting something more,<br/>
but she never changes.

lost in her own reflections<br/>
her eyes begin to blur<br/>
and suddenly the images are clearer<br/>
a million tiny pieces.

she sees the fragments<br/>
remnants of umet expectations<br/>
a graveyard for her long forgotten dreams<br/>
a work of picasso.

the image has surpassed distortion<br/>
priorities skewed beyond recognition<br/>
leaving behind the person she once valued above all<br/>
only pieces of herself
